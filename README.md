This is an easy way to use a dataset as the training dataset to do the land use classification, even though that dataset doesn't have the value in your study area. For example, NLCD 2019: USGS National Land Cover Database only has value in America. Still, here it can use as the training dataset to get the land use categories(NLCD) in Singapore.


**Reminder：In here just exhibit an example(or prototype). It still has many challenges to address if you want to apply it to scientific research.**
