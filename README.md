This is an easy way to use the dataset as the training dataset to do the land use classification, even though that dataset doesn't have the value in the study area. For example, NLCD 2019: USGS National Land Cover Database only has value in America. Still, here it can use as the training dataset to get the land use categories(nlcd) in Singapore.
